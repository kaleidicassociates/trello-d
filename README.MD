Trello API for the D programming language
=========================================
Automated wrapper generation to call the Trello API from the D programming language

Warning
-------
It is adapted to internal libraries and depends on our internal Variable tagged algebraic/variant type and will require some adaptation for use outside our firm.  I will do so when/if time.

Current status
--------------
* A few hacks to deal with errors in the documentation JSON used to generate the API.
* Builds and simple things work when I have used it
* Needs tests.
