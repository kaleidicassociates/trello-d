# Trello API for the D programming language
Automated wrapper generation to call the Trello API from the D programming language

## Warning
It is adapted to internal libraries and depends on our internal Variable tagged algebraic/variant type and will require some adaptation for use outside our firm.  I will do so when/if time.

## Current status
- A few hacks to deal with errors in the documentation JSON used to generate the API.
- Builds and simple things work when I have used it
- Needs tests.
